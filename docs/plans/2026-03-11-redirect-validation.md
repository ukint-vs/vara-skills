# Redirect Validation

## Target
- Workspace: `<sails-root>/examples/redirect`
- Command: `bash scripts/run_gtest.sh <sails-root>/examples/redirect`

## Result
- Status: blocked by the local Sails workspace state
- Script exit code: `101`
- Parser summary: `failed to load manifest for workspace member \`<sails-root>/benchmarks/alloc-stress\``

## Evidence
The wrapper surfaced a Cargo workspace error before any gtest execution:

```text
error: failed to load manifest for workspace member `<sails-root>/benchmarks/alloc-stress`
referenced by workspace at `<sails-root>/Cargo.toml`
```

## Interpretation
- `scripts/run_gtest.sh` correctly preserves the non-zero exit.
- `scripts/parse_test_output.py` now classifies cargo-level failures as `error` instead of a false `passed`.
- The remaining blocker is outside this repository and must be fixed in `<sails-root>` before the redirect example can be used as a green acceptance target.
