# Vara Skills

This wrapper exposes the same provisional `vara-skills` pack to OpenClaw.

The pack is self-contained inside this repo: load the local handbook and local skills instead of depending on sibling repositories.

## Start Here

Load the repo router at `../SKILL.md`, then begin with `ship-sails-app`.

## Route By Task

- Local Rust or Gear setup: `../skills/sails-dev-env/SKILL.md`
- New app: `../skills/sails-new-app/SKILL.md`
- Existing feature work: `../skills/sails-feature-workflow/SKILL.md`
- Message flow or reply behavior: `../skills/gear-message-execution/SKILL.md`
- Service or program design: `../skills/sails-architecture/SKILL.md`
- IDL or generated client issues: `../skills/sails-idl-client/SKILL.md`
- `gtest` authoring or debugging: `../skills/sails-gtest/SKILL.md`
- Local-node smoke after green tests: `../skills/sails-local-smoke/SKILL.md`

## Scope

This pack is for standard Gear/Vara Sails builders. The catalog is provisional and should be treated as a measured candidate set, not a frozen public taxonomy.
